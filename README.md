# Hyperparameter Optimization: This Tutorial Is All You Need

In this video, I show you how you can use different hyperparameter optimization techniques and libraries to tune hyperparameters of almost any kind of model or just to optimize any function!

# End-to-End: Automated Hyperparameter Tuning For Deep Neural Networks

In this video, I am going to show you how you can do #HyperparameterOptimization​ for a #NeuralNetwork​ automatically using Optuna. 

This is an end-to-end video in which I select a problem and design a neural network in #PyTorch​ and then I find the optimal number of layers, drop out, learning rate, and other parameters using Optuna.

The dataset used in this video can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa​
